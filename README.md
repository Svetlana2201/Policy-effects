# Policy-effects
The repository contains computer programs and codes for main procedures for ‘Testing for policy effects in a nonlinear time series model’ paper (jointly with W. Charemza, C. Francq, R. Lupu and J-M Zakoian). 
All computations were made using Aptech GAUSS programs, versions 20 (Unix) and 23 (Windows). The Unix version of GAUSS was used for computations performed on the HPC ALICE facility at the University of Leicester, that is for Monte Carlo simulations, computing   and   statistics and their p-values. The Windows version of GAUSS was used for paired difference and means difference bootstrap testing, graphical analysis and for most of the robustness tests. 
Estimation of ARMA-GARCH and DAR models on a PC requires constrained optimization Aptech GAUSS package (version CO_2.0_WIN or CO_2.0_DOS) to be installed. 
Only the codes for the core and original procedures are given below. Other procedures and full Windows and Unix programmes are available on request.
